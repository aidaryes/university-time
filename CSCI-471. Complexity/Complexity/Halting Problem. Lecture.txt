Relationship between Atm and HALTtm
Recognizer for HALTtm will Accept on accept/reject
Decider for HALTtm wiill reject on Loop forever and accept otherwise
I guess Decider for HALTtm is not possible?

Decider for hulk
Theorem: HALT is undecidable

Proof:
Suppose we have decider R for HALTtm. With R we can consutruct TM that can decide Atm, but that is not possible.
All regular languages are decidable
Kinds of languages
-Decidable (Context-free and Regular languages)
-Undecidable (Atm and HALTtm)
-Unrecognizable (-Atm)
if A is decidable then A' is decidable
if A is undecidable then A' is unrecognizable
if A is unrecognizable, then A' is undecidable
Which Languages class?

1) Binary-Palindrome
2) -F (where F is finite)
3) Aaaa = {<M> | M is s TM that accepts string aaa}
4) Etm = {<M> | M is s TM that accepts nothing}
5) -Etm
6) EQtm = {<M1, M2> | M1 and M2 are TMs that accept exactly the same string}
7) -EQtm
1) decidable
2) decidable
3) recognizable, undecidable
4) unrecognizable
5) unrecognizable
6) unrecognizable
7) unrecognizable
is it right?
